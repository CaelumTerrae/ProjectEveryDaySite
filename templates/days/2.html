<h2>Day 2</h2>
</header>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p> So although technically the first day of this challenge was <a href="/day/1">yesterday</a>, this site was not "live" until today. Reading about this difference might be boring if you have absolutely no interest in web development, so if you fit into this bucket, you might want to skip ahead to the section titled: <b>The Interesting Stuff.</b> Before you go and skip ahead though, the difficulties I experienced in today's project might be a little informative for <b>The Interesting Stuff</b>, so maybe read <b>The Boring Stuff</b> if you want this background knowledge.<br>
Tl;dr: Read whatever interests you. You were probably going to do that anyway.</p>
<h3>The Boring Stuff</h3>
<p>I spent most of yesterday coding up the site, and then spent all of today trying to deploy the site. The difference is subtle but important. Building a site is the work of designing site layout, and coding the server that does the work of delivering information. Deployment is the beast that is hooking up all of the components of a website to the internet so that one can actually access the site online.</p>
<p>The process of deploying might seem much easier than the process of building out all of the components of an actual website. Holy crap is that not the case. I spent a decent amount of time building out the components of the site yesterday, and making minor changes to make it more aesthetically appealing (~7 hours). At the end of the day, I was satisfied with the end product. I made a website that might be the start of a year of projects, and productivity.</p>
<p>In contrast, I spent more than 10 hours today deploying this site. The process of navigating the various tutorials and paywalls necessary to put this online was filled with trial and error and more error. I hit one wall trying to find out what service to use to host the site. I hit another trying to purchase a domain for the site. I hit yet another trying to get this domain to navigate to the hosting service I had purchased. All of this wasn't a creative process, nor a particularly interesting one, and at the end of the day instead of feeling satisfied, I was disappointed at the amount of time it took.</p>
<h3>The Interesting Stuff</h3>
<p>Today, I had a conversation with one of my most intelligent/creative/best friends, <a href="http://www.braedonvillano.com/">Braedon Villano</a>, on the idea of this project. We got into a discussion about how feasible it is to actually do a project every single day. He argued that there will be many days like this one where I will be stifled by the mundane parts of a project. There will likely be many projects that require a lot of leg work to get them off of the ground. Leg work that is boring and frustrating. And then at the very end of the conversation, he brought up <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531911/isaac-asimov-asks-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/">this essay on creativity and where ideas come from</a> by <em>Isaac Asimov</em>.</p>
<p>I won't make you read the whole thing if you don't want to (see the tl;dr in the intro), but here is one quote in particular that stuck with me:<br>
<div style="color:#000000;">My feeling is that as far as creativity is concerned, isolation is required. The creative person is, in any case, continually working at it. His mind is shuffling his information at all times, even when he is not conscious of it. (The famous example of Kekule working out the structure of benzene in his sleep is well-known.)<br>
The presence of others can only inhibit this process, since creation is embarrassing. For every new good idea you have, there are a hundred, ten thousand foolish ones, which you naturally do not care to display.</div></p>
<p>I expect that of the 365 projects I do this year, there will probably be 10-14 that are worthwhile. I am also embarassed by the amount of time that it took me to deploy this website. While a more experienced individual might be able to do today's project in 5 (five) minutes, and might make 365 worthwhile projects in one (1) year, it's important to share the true experience of doing a project every single day. That means showing the triumphant moments, the failures, and everything in-between.</p>
<p>As a final note, this challenge/project/whatever might more aptly be named "new process every day", but the current title is more pithy/catchy so I'll stick with it.</p>

<p>Until tomorrow,<br>GPL</p>
